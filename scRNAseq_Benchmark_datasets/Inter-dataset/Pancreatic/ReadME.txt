This folder contains the files for the inter dataset Pancreatic experiments.

Two datafiles can be found here. Combined_HumanPancreas_data.csv contains the original counts of the four
concatenated pancreatic datasets. Combined_HumanPancreas_data_aligned.csv contains the data after alignment.
The folder also contains an artificially made RData file containing the training and test folds. This file can be passed to the classifiers together with the labels and one of the datasets. The statistics.xlsx file contains the indices of each dataset when used as training and test set.
